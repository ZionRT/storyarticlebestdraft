<h3 style="text-align:center;">Do you want to learn more about suspense? Read this article to understand more about suspense.</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;margin-left:200px; margin-right:200px;">I’ll understand more about suspense by finding out how H.P. Lovecraft uses sensory language, and mood or narrator’s point of view, to create suspense. I’ll take two quotes from the short story, and infer what I think to show how he creates suspense in “The Thing in The Moonlight”.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;margin-left:200px; margin-right:200px;">If you don’t know what suspense is, suspense is basically when you don’t know what’s going to happen next in, for example, a story.</p>
<p>happen next in, for example, a story.
“The Thing in The Moonlight” is based off of a dream Lovecraft had. Here is an example of using sensory language to create suspense, which talks about what he sees. “After walking for some distance, I encountered the rusty tracks of a street railway,
 and the worm-eaten poles which still held the limp and sagging trolley wire.” (Lovecraft 1) This is important to the story because it gives you an idea of the old worn-out area he’s in, setting the mood; implying foreshadowing. 
</p>
<p>He uses the narrator’s point of view to create suspense as well, for example, in this quote, where he sees shadowy figures. “I heard a swishing in the sparse grass toward the left, and saw the dark forms of two men looming up in the moonlight. They had the regulation caps of a railway company, and I could not doubt but that they were conductor and motorman. Then one of them sniffed with singular sharpness, and raised his face to howl to the moon. The other dropped on all fours to run toward the car.” (Lovecraft 1) </p>
<p>This help/s create suspense since the narrator sees two new dark figures, in the clothes of a motorman and conductor, and you can’t be sure what’s going to happen next. This is important in the story because it creates suspense, bringing in two new characters.</p>
<p>Both of these literary devices are important to the story since they help set the quiet, dark mood of the story, and then create suspense, till he sees that the conductor or motorman’s face is one tentacle, so he gets up and leaves, then waking up from the nightmare.</p>
<p>I learned more about suspense, and more about how Lovecraft creates and uses it. It was important to learn how Lovecraft creates suspense, as it helps with understanding suspense, and how to use it.
</p>
<p>The story is fine. It’s just a somewhat scary nightmare. I’ve heard of things much scarier. After starting this working draft, I noticed a lot more suspense than I did making the story article outline. It seems it has truly made me understand SUSpense better.
